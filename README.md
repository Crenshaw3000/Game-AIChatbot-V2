# Game Rules AI Chatbot<br />

The Game Rules AI Chatbot is designed to provide specialized knowledge 
on the rules of Monopoly, Uno, and Yahtzee. Users can ask it questions about 
these games, and the chatbot will retrieve accurate answers. It leverages PDFs as 
information sources and employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the 
powerful large language model (LLM), Ollama, to process and respond to queries effectively.
